//I have tested all properties of my shape classes working or not after making in browser as that comes with default svg parser.

//It is mentioned that it is optional to include the tests in submission folder in class.

//So they are put in a single file called combined_tests.cpp under test folder (path--> test/combined_test.cpp) it is 475 lines of code.

So, I havenot taken efforts to break combined_tests.cpp in around 100 lines .cpp files as they are  obviously optional  and the code is
intentionally kept commented in that .cpp file just for showcase basically.
